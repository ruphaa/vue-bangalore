## What?

Vue is the approachable, versatile and performant progressive javascript framework.

## Why?

You should attend if:

- You're new to frontend / frameworks, e.g.
  - Backend engineers
  - Folks working with jQuery
  - Folks working on Angular / React but are keen to explore the buzz around Vue!
- You're about to start a new project, e.g.
  - Working in a start-up where you want to quickly experiment with things (Vue is an easy-to-pick frontend framework with documented ways of doing common things)
  - Working in a large company and are evaluating options
- You're already working on Vue and want to connect with like-minded people

We host regular full-day workshops as well as a getting-started workshop at the start of every meetup.
